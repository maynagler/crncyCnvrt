# crncyCnvrt

CurncyCnvrt is just a basic currency convertor.

well, this is just a test-project I did on my spare time when I was intrested on how does Chrome Extensions work. 
It was actually useful at the end - and I am using this extension from time to time.
(P.S - I used a free API for the currency rates - so it might be a bit off sometimes due to the API updates).
